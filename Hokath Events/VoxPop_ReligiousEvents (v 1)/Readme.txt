These events, flagged as civ specific for the level of gameplay affected, feature a series of 6 choices (which are GOOD or TRADE) each requiring the completion of the previous.
To begin an event, construct a religion-specific national wonder. They follow the format of:
1. temples and wonder +2 yield
2. wonder specific effect
3. faith buildings and wonder +3 yield
4. wonder +20% yield modifier
5. either: more spies, level up spies, reduce spy effectiveness or civil servants +yield+faith
6. wonder specific effect
Where 'yield' is the same as the yield holy sites receive from the wonder.

Currently there is nothing preventing multiple quests from being accepted if you should somehow be able to construct multiple wonders. 
If this somehow turns out to be a feasible way to break the game, we'll revisit the Event_EventLinks.
